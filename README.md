# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-System
k Nearest Neighbours (kNN) based Hand Gesture Recognition System in MATLAB

The project predicts the hand-gesture represented within an image from a set of 5 pre-defined gesture categories. The images are pre-processed through image-segmentation. 5 features (mean, standard deviation, skewness, entropy and kurtosis) are obtained and k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm has been used to perform the classfication.

Download the folder and run the code/main.m file in MATLAB. The calculated efficiency is printed is output.
